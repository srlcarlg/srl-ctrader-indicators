¹ _Indicators/cBots section removed after February 1st 2025, where they dumped the community's codebase to an unknown fate._

**~~Folder names are self-explanatory~~**

_.NET 6.0_ are the indicators compiled (_with source code_) in cTrader in their respective versions of the .NET Framework.

_Raw Source Code_ are the .cs files in case the compiled .algo doesn't work in the future or the cAlgo API have major modifications that require manual refactoring.
